Recently I have been reading 'The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People' by Stephen Covey. This is the second time I am reading the book,
and I found that it has had a positive impact on my life. Thus, I'd like to share the information from the book with you.

This post will be about the 'introduction' to the book, and the first (and arguably most important habit), 'Be Proactive'.

## Inside Out

Before we even get into these seven habits, we first need to understand how and **why** we act the way we do. Because a lot of times
are reactions are only reactions. Without any conscious decision we react to something that happens before we know it. This can be because
that is how we learned to react, either from our parents, friends colleagues or anyone else. Or we react like that because its our instinct.
Which means that our reasoning, our actions, are because of the outside, we aren't in control of our lives.

What we need is a paradigm shift. Which means that we need to start looking at the world through a different lens. We need to reason from the within.
If you know what is important to you, then you can make decisions based on that. These could be things like honesty, integrity, but also the will to
teach other people. These are thing that do not change throughout your life, as these are the corner stones on which your life should be built.
These are the principles on which you can base everything else. They should serve as the compass in your life.

Now this may all sound kind of preachy. And in all honesty it is. The most important part to take away here, is that you need to have a set of unchangeable
principles, on which you can base your decisions and actions. Just defining your principles in life is already quite hard. But I would advise you to take
a look at what your daily activities look like. Are they in line with these principles?

I have skipped over a lot of (important) parts of the 'inside out' section, so I would advise you to get this book and give it a read yourself if this
sounds interesting to you.

## Habit one: Be Proactive

This first habit is to be proactive. This means to take the initiative in your life. Act instead of being acted upon. If we have the previously discussed
principles, we can start putting them to work. The first step is just to realize how often we are being reactive, and act without thinking about it. Now at first
you may realize days later that an action you took wasn't in line with your principles, that you should have acted differently. The goal is to realize this
sooner and sooner, until you are able to react with your principles in mind in the moment itself.

One step you can take to start being more proactive is to change your language. I found myself saying *'I must'* or *'I have to'* quite often. While the reality
is that we don't *have* to do anything. It just means that there are consequences to not doing something. So when your boss calls you late at night, because
there is an emergency, you don't *have* to go. There can be, sometimes harsh, consequences if you don't go. But it is still a choice that you make. Now of course
you need to think about the consequences, but there are also consequences for going. You may miss a night out with friends, or you cant watch that movie that you
wanted to with your family. You can however, reason from your principles, and decide what is more important to you.

Another thing to focus on is where you place your concerns, and what you can influence. To take the example of the weather, no mater how angry or sad you get
over a rainy day, it won't change anything. We can look at these two circles, our circle of concern, and our circle of influence, and generally they will look
like the following image. We have influence over a lot of thing, but there are also a lot of thing outside of this circle of influence that we are concerned
about.

By actively working in our circle of influence, we can expand it. We can't expand it by only worrying about things we have no control over.

Now this is just the start of the book, and i intend to write about the other habits at a later point. But once again, if you think this may be
relevant to you, consider reading the book for yourself, as this is just a high level overview.

Do you think you are proactive? Do you spend too much energy on your circle of concern, rather than your circle of influence? Let me know in the comments.
