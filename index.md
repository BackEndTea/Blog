## Welcome to my blog

I'm Gert de Pagter, also known as BackEndTea on the internet. I'm learning new
things every day, and I use my [blog posts]({% link blog/index.html %}) to share that knowledge
with the rest of the world.

In my spare time I contribute to [open source](https://www.github.com/BackEndTea) and play Dungeons and Dragons.

### Contact

You can reach me by [mail](mailto:BackEndTea@gmail.com), or DM me on [twitter](https://www.twitter.com/BackEndTea).
